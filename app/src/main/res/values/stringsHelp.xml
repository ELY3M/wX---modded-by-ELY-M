</string>

    <string name="radar_use_jni_label">
Use JNI ( native C code ) for performance sensitive areas in radar.
        Although this performs better for fast animations, in general it is not as robust as the default Kotlin based code.
         If this works without any crashes that is great but if not I recommend to turn it off.
        It was helpful in the 2014-2017 time frame but as devices have gotten faster the need is not as great.
        All future development is occurring in the Kotlin code base.

    <string name="help_radar">
    The Nexrad radar interface allows pinch zoom, double tap to zoom in, single tap to zoom out, long press on the screen to bring up a contextual menu
        allowing you to do a variety of things. A number of radar products and animation options are available in the toolbar menu.
        "Tools -> Radar" (also available from the main screen as "Settings -> Radar") can be be used to enable a variety of layers
        such as warnings and watches.
</string>

    <string name="help_radar_drawing_tools">

        When "Share / Drawing Tools" is selected from the sub-menu, a recording toolbar appears in the top right of the screen.
        You will need to approve and enable various Android permissions to allow this to happen.
        In the recording toolbar at the top, options exist for a drawing tool and with single pane radar a distance tool.
        When the drawing tool or distance tool are engaged, you are not able to pan or zoom the radar. When you stop the drawing tool all markings are removed.
        You can also use the "X" to close the toolbar which will clear the distance and/or drawing tool markings.
        Default color is red but is configurable in settings->colors. The width of the line is also configurable.

    <string name="help_radar_recording">

         For screen recording and screenshots files can be shared and are written to your SDCARD
        in “Android/data/joshuatee.wx/files/Movies" and "DCIM”. All users will notice a popup requesting permission to record the screen.
        You may need to tap “share” multiple times to enable all of the necessary permissions.
        After the first time it will come up on first touch. To use this new feature simply select “Shared / Drawing Tools” from the submenu in single
        or multi-pane nexrad radar and you will notice a floating and persistent set of icons in the upper right which allows you
        to exit the icon pane, take a screenshot, and record a video respectively. If you take a video by default the video will
        start immediately  ( a 3 second delay can be enabled in Settings->Radar->Screen Recorder ).
        Once the recorder is running the icons will disappear ( since you are literally getting everything on the screen
        including any panning/zooming or product changes ). To stop the recording simply tap the screen in the same location
        the recording used to be. Once a video or screenshot have been captured a notification will fire and from there you can view or
        share the given media file.
