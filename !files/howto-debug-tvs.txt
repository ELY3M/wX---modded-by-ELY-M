I have to root my test phone.... 
get a sn file with tvs in it... 
put it in shared folder in the files area.  


        //WXGLDownload.getNidsTab(context, "TVS", rid, tvsBaseFn + fnSuffix)
        File("/data/user/0/joshuatee.wx/files/shared/sn.0216").copyTo(File("/data/user/0/joshuatee.wx/files/nids_tvs_tab0"), true);



be sure to uncomment and remove copy file in prod apk
