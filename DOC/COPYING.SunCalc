# SunCalc.swift

A direct port of [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) javascript library ([commit b08d1f6f8](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc/commit/b08d1f6f8e56a3c0d85469d6cf0ff8675cba40a5)). Which means this port inherits the same accuracy and issues with the original javascript library. 

## Updated

Now `SunCalc` can handle polar region's "Mid-night sun". Errors are now embeded in `SunCalc` class:

```swift
SunCalc.SolarEventError.sunNeverRise
SunCalc.SolarEventError.sunNeverSet

SunCalc.LunarEventError.moonNeverRise(Date?) // An optional date for moonset time.
SunCalc.LunarEventError.moonNeverSet(Date?) // An optional date for moonrise time.
```

`Location` now become `SunCalc.Location`.

## Examples

```swift
// DateFormatter
let formatter = DateFormatter()
formatter.dateStyle = .short
formatter.timeStyle = .short
formatter.timeZone = .current

// Sunrise and sunset
let sunCalc = SunCalc()
let now = Date()
let location = SunCalc.Location(latitude: 25.0, longitude: 120.0)
if let riseTime = try? sunCalc.time(ofDate: now, forSolarEvent: .sunrise, atLocation: location) {
    let sunrise = formatter.string(from: riseTime)
    print("Sunrise: \(sunrise)")
}
if let setTime = try? sunCalc.time(ofDate: now, forSolarEvent: .sunset, atLocation: location) {
    let sunset = formatter.string(from: setTime)
    print("Sunset: \(sunset)")
}

// Moon rise and moon set
let moonTimes = try? sunCalc.moonTimes(date: now, location: location)
if let moonTimes = moonTimes {
    print("Moonrise: \(formatter.string(from: moonTimes.moonRiseTime))")
    print("Moonset: \(formatter.string(from: moonTimes.moonSetTime))")
}
```

## Known Issue

Moon rise and set time sometimes not correct. See [Issue #1](https://github.com/imvenj/SunCalc.swift/issues/1)
