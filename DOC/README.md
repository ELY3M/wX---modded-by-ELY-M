wX is a free and Open Source (GPL3) Android application that is geared towards storm chasers,
meteorologists, and weather enthusiasts but can be used by anyone with ease. The application is for
the contiguous 48 states in the US however Alaska and Hawaii are partially supported. Additionally
Puerto Rico and Guam now have limited support as documented in "BUGS"

Features include:

- NWS current conditions and 7 day forecast for unlimited locations. Click on current conditions and
  you will get the SPC sounding/hodograph image
  for that NWS office. Everything on the first screen is clickable and usually expands or shows more
  data.
- Action bar icons provide direct access to AFD ( area forecast discussion ), NEXRAD interface for
  your location,
  Visible/IR imagery, statewide observations, and a graphic of nearby weather alerts.
- SPC tab with access to most SPC products include Severe weather outlooks, storm reports,
  Mesoanalysis, thunderstorm outlook, MCD
  (mesoscale discussions), watches, and SPC SREF. Interfaces are not raw web pages but instead use
  native Android widget thus providing a mobile optimized and enhanced interface.
- MISC tab with access to the COD Model interface data with a native Android interface (including
  GFS, NAM, RAP, HRRR, NAM4KM, SREF),
  NWS Radar mosaics, and twitter widgets with the 20 most recent entries for state searches (
  example: #miwx ), #tornado, and weather underground.
- NEXRAD interface (accessible from action bar) with favorites, map selection, multiple products,
  and animation.
- Interface to view current severe weather alerts in the US. For example The tile icon by default
  will show any Tornado or severe Tstorm warning.
- Text to speech for many text based activities
- Voice recognition for basic operations from the main screen.

* severe weather alerts for locations
* optionally when an alert occurs provide an Android BigPicture notification containing the current
  base reflectivity from your radar site

OPENING SCREEN NOTE: Everything on the opening screen is clickable. Clicking on most text will
expand it or take you somewhere else.
Current conditions at top starts with temp (heat index or wind chill if present) / dew point (
relative humidity).

SPC MESO, US Alerts, and MODELS NOTE: Each activity uses a "navigation drawer" so swipe from the
left border to the center of the
screen to access the drawer and to change model parameters ( or location ). Presence of the nav
drawer is indicated by a different
ICON in the upper left corner ( not the arrow ).
