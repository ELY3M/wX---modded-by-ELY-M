These apps do not collect any data from the user or the user’s device only during normal usage and not crashing.  

I am using Acra Logger from http://www.acra.ch/
It will catch any crashes on this app and it will ask you to send me email crash logs.  
You will be sending your phone brand, model, infos, app's settings, catlog, stack traces to help me to solve any crashing issues.  

I have Spotter Network Auto Report your current GPS location. 
if you add your application key and enable auto report your location.  
you will be submitting your GPS location automatically to Spotter Network for your beacon to show up on any maps or radar with Spotter Network.
