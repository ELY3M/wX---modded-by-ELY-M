Thank you to Joshua Tee for this app! 

This app is intended to be my replacmement of my favorite app called pykl3   
and I intended to keep this app open sourced!    

this app will be customized for me and anyone who wants.  

Joshua Tee is welcome to add any of changes I did.  




1. conus radar overlay when you zoom out like on pykl3 
2. get special weather statements working - not working due because they do not have vtec like all other warnings.  
3. add rda and tdwrs icon/names and add in options to enable/disable showing rdas/tdwrs 
4. add third button for SRM on radar - might 4th one for cc   
5. add request for sn spotter in the tap menu 
6. allow custom icons! exp tvs and hail and gps location and cities dots - partily done.  
7. add read mcd/mpd text like read warnings text in the radar tap menu 
8. fix up my own velicity color table 
9. add warning list within radar



DONE! 
=================================
Spotter Network intergretion for spotters (add your SN key in the settings) 
seperate screen on and auto refresh into 2 options. easy! 
zoom out bug fixed!  obs / spotters / tvs disappear when you zoom out.
