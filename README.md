# wX app modded by ELY M.

Thank you to Joshua Tee for this app! 

This app is intended to be my replacmement of my favorite app called pykl3   
and I intended to keep this app open sourced!    

this app will be customized for me and anyone who wants.  

Joshua Tee is welcome to add any of changes I did.  




=================================

TO DO List: 

1. conus radar overlay when you zoom out like on pykl3 
2. get special weather statements working - not working due because they do not have vtec like all other warnings.  
3. add rda and tdwrs icon/names and add in options to enable/disable showing rdas/tdwrs 
4. add third button for SRM on radar - might 4th one for cc   
6. allow custom icons! exp tvs and hail and gps location and cities dots - partily done.  
7. add read mcd/mpd text like read warnings text in the radar tap menu 
8. fix up my own velicity color table 
9. add warning list within radar



DONE! 
=================================
seperate warnings option on radar.. so can enable and disable indidvual warnings on radar. for example, you only want to see tor/svr and you can disable all others.  
added SVS (severe weather statement)  
added request for sn spotter info in the tap menu in the radar  
Spotter Network intergretion for spotters (add your SN key in the settings)   
seperate screen on and auto refresh into 2 options. easy!   
zoom out bug fixed!  obs / spotters / tvs disappear when you zoom out.
